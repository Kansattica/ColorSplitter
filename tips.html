Hello and welcome to <a href="/colorsplit">Color Splitter!</a> Here's some hot tips to help you make the most of it.
<ul class="tiplist">
	<li>Upload three images, one for each of the three boxes on the left.</li>
	<li>I like to upload three slightly different pictures of the same thing.</li>
	<li>It works best with three images that are about the same size. Images that are way smaller compared to the others might be hard to place.</li>
	<li>Once you have all three, they'll be split into their red, green, and blue components and reassembled on the right.</li>
	<li>Drag the little images around their boxes to drag the components around. I like to line things up over the eyes or some such.</li>
	<li>Right click on the right side to save or copy the image. You'll likely have to crop it in another image editor.</li>
	<li>The final image resolution will be the same as on your screen, so you can zoom out (ctrl+minus sign) and refresh the page to try again with a higher resolution.</li>
	<li>The size of the boxes get set when the page loads, so any window size changes or zooming in/out will only take effect if you refresh the page.</li>
	<li>The red and blue separation apparently works pretty good with red-blue 3D glasses.</li>
	<li>This program is mostly for making fine adjustments- if you want to shift an image by more than the input allows, I suggest padding it with black in another image editor.</li>
	<li>This program runs entirely on your computer. The images never leave your machine, and it'll even work without internet at all.</li>
	<li>The sample picture is of <a href=imag://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid_Mir_Muhammad_Alim_Khan">Sayyid Mir Muhammad Alim Khan</a>, and it's one of the first color photos ever taken.</li>
	<li>It was produced by taking three pictures, one through a red filter, one through a blue, and one through a green, and combining them after the fact. Color Splitter is recombining them for you.</li>
	<li>You can see the original film scans I used at <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Rgb-compose-Alim_Khan.jpg">Wikimedia Commons</a>.</li>
	<li>There's not really any source code beyond what's already been downloaded to your computer, but you can <a href="https://github.com/Kansattica/ColorSplitter">fork me on Github if you like</a>.</li>
	<li>Have fun!</li>

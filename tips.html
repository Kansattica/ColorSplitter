Hello and welcome to Color Splitter!
<ul>
	<li>Upload three images, one for each of the three boxes on the left.</li>
	<li>I like to upload three slightly different pictures of the same thing.</li>
	<li>Once you have all three, they'll be split into their red, green, and blue components and reassembled on the right.</li>
	<li>Drag the little images around their boxes to drag the components around. I like to line things up over the eyes or some such.</li>
	<li>Right click on the right side to save or copy the image.</li>
	<li>The final image resolution will be the same as on your screen, so you can zoom out (ctrl+minus sign) and refresh the page to try again with a higher resolution.</li>
	<li>The size of the boxes get set when the page loads, so any window size changes or zooming in/out will only take effect if you refresh the page.</li>
	<li>The red and blue separation apparently works pretty good with red-blue 3D glasses.</li>
	<li>This program is mostly for making fine adjustments- if you want to shift an image by more than the input allows, I suggest padding it with black in another image editor.</li>
	<li>Have fun!</li>
